=========================

<img align="left" width="110" src="images/photo_2018.jpg"> I am currently Senior Research Scientist at [Unbabel](http://www.unbabel.com/) and associate researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.l2f.inesc-id.pt/w/Welcome_to_the_Spoken_Language_Systems_Lab) in Lisboa. I got here starting from signal processing, then speech recognition, natural language processing and now machine learning as a whole. I ended up spending verly large chunks of my life in Spain, Germany and now Portugal. It is hard to find things that do not interest me, but artificial and crowd intelligence seem particularly motivating in this moment in history. If this does feel short as a description see below, there is a lot of stuff below.

### 2016
From 2016 I am Senior Research Scientist at Unbabel, keeping also an affiliation to INESC-ID as associate researcher. I am also co-founder of the Special Interest group for Robust Speech Processing (RoSP-SIG) and organizer of the LxMLS summer schools 2015 till present.

### 2010
I obtained the title with distinction in 2010 in the fields of speech processing and robust automatic speech recognition. In my thesis "Integration of Short-Time Fourier Domain Speech Enhancement and Observation Uncertainty Techniques for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition" I formalized the concept of Short-Time Fourier Uncertainty Propagation (STFT-UP) and its relation to speech enhancement techniques such as the Wiener or Ephraim-Malah filters.

I was awarded with a FCT Post-Doctoral scholarship to join INESC-ID/L2F where I researched both robust speech recognition and robust natural language processing speech applications mixing deep learning and latent variable models.

### 2006
I worked as an intern at Peiker Acustic researching model-based speech enhancement. On this same year I was awarded with a La Caixa and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) scholarship for research towards the Ph.D. degree at the EMSP department of the Technische Universität Berlin.

### 2005
I got my industrial engineering degree at the Escuela Politecnica Superior de Ingenieria de Gijon (Spain). At the time this was a 6 year multidisciplinary degree plus thesis. In theory my specialization was electronic and automatics. In practice this covered from industrial heat and cold to macro economy and project managment. I also got to visit all stuff programing from VHDL and x86 CISC to Visual C++ and MFCs (no Python sadly).
